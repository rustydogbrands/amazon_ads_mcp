"""Atomic JSON writer used by the v1 catalog refresh CLI.

Adapted from `.build/spec_utils/io.py:save_json`. The two meaningful
differences:

1. Commit uses `os.replace(tmp, target)` rather than `tmp.replace(target)`.
   Tests in Phase B monkeypatch `amazon_ads_mcp.build.atomic_json.os.replace`
   to simulate mid-commit crashes; keeping the call at the module level
   preserves that test seam.
2. Parent directories are created on demand so the CLI can write into a
   fresh destination.

Formatting is locked for determinism: sorted keys, 2-space indent,
`ensure_ascii=False`, trailing newline. Two writes with identical input
produce a byte-identical output.
